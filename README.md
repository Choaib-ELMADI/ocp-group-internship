## Architecture

The system architecture integrates various components:

- **PLC (Programmable Logic Controller):** Manages real-time control and automation.
- **HMI (Human-Machine Interface):** Provides operators with a user-friendly interface for monitoring and controlling the system.
- **Remote Supervision:** Enables monitoring and control from a centralized location.
- **Data Management:** Utilizes data from sensors and other inputs to optimize storage processes and ensure system reliability.

## Technologies and Tools

- **PLC Programming:** Using Automation Studio and Step7 SIMATIC Manager
- **HMI Development:** For creating intuitive operator interfaces
- **Simulation Tools:** To test and validate system functionality
- **Data Analytics:** For performance monitoring and optimization
